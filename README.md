# Internet Gaming Database (IGDB)

## Description

Welcome to IGDB, or Internet Gaming Database!

IGDB is a command-line interface (CLI) application that allows users to search for video games based on their console or genre preferences. Users can interact with menus to add, delete, find one, and find all consoles, genres, and games. 

Internet Gaming Database is a phase 3 project for Flatiron School's software engineering course. This project includes 3 model classes and 1 one-to-many relationship.
